# Airy.TV
## Create IPTV playlists and EPG data for Airy.TV

### What is this?
This is a simple python script to create an m3u8 and xml file for the Airy.TV live streaming service.

## How can I use these channels?
You can use these channels by downloading and running the script on any device that can run python, then adding the files to pretty much any IPTV app, including the likes of Kodi, Emby, etc. I won't list a 'how-to' here since there are so many different apps available, but you can find walkthrough's for almost all apps by just Google searching for your app of choice with the search term 'setup' added.

**NOTE:** The m3u8 and xml file supplied are for example purposes only! While the m3u8 *may* work in a player, the xml **will not**. You **must** run your own scripts.
